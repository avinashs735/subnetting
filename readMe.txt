This is version 1, allowing you to put an IP address and a subnet mask, to find the network and host address. The next version will allow you to make subnets.

To compile this programme yourself, make sure;
all the source code is in the same folder

type in a DOS window, javac *.java to compile all the source code
type jar -cvfm subnetCalc.jar manifest.txt *.class

that will put all the files in an executable jar file
